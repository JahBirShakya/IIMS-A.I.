Artificial Intelligence:
"What Computers can't do yet"
Branch of computer science accruing machine learning to perform any general or narrow level tasks autonomously and adaptively.

Machine learning
art of extracting knowledge from data
Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.

Supervised learning: We are given an input, for example a photograph with a traffic sign, and the task is to predict the correct output or label, for example which traffic sign is in the picture (speed limit, stop sign, etc.). In the simplest cases, the answers are in the form of yes/no (we call these binary classification problems).

Unsupervised learning: There are no labels or correct outputs. The task is to discover the structure of the data: for example, grouping similar items to form “clusters”, or reducing the data to a small number of important “dimensions”. Data visualization can also be considered unsupervised learning.

Reinforcement learning: Commonly used in situations where an AI agent like a self-driving car must operate in an environment and where feedback about good or bad choices is available with some delay. Also used in games where the outcome may be decided only at the end of the game.

Philosophy:

The Turing Test: An entity is intelligent if it cannot be distinguished from another intelligent entity by observing its behavior.
