"Tasks that Computers can't do yet"
# Artificial Intelligence
AI is the branch of computer science accruing machine learning to perform any general or narrow level tasks autonomously and adaptively.
## Machine learning 
* Art of extracting knowledge from data
* Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.
### Types:
1. Supervised learning: We are given an input, for example a photograph with a traffic sign, and the task is to predict the correct output or label, for example which traffic sign is in the picture (speed limit, stop sign, etc.). In the simplest cases, the answers are in the form of yes/no (we call these binary classification problems).
2. Unsupervised learning: There are no labels or correct outputs. The task is to discover the structure of the data: for example, grouping similar items to form “clusters”, or reducing the data to a small number of important “dimensions”. Data visualization can also be considered unsupervised learning.
3. Reinforcement learning: Commonly used in situations where an AI agent like a self-driving car must operate in an environment and where feedback about good or bad choices is available with some delay. Also used in games where the outcome may be decided only at the end of the game.
# AI Perspectives
Intelligence can be subjected as a property of either _thought _processes or in terms of _behavioral _characteristics.

AI deals with the science of making machines intelligent capable of achieving one of the following definition:
* Think Humanly :- Cognitive Science, Neuroscience approach
* Act Humanly :- The Turing Test: An entity is intelligent if it cannot be distinguished from another intelligent entity by observing its behavior  {Focusing on things like don't answer too quickly, don't spell too well}
* Think Rationally :- Uncertain because difficult to encode how to think, and in the end it's not about how you think, it's about how you end up acting
* Act Rationally :- Rational Agent to achieve the optimum result i.e. maximizing your expected utility

# History of AI

* 1943-1956: The inception of Artificial Intelligence
> 1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain
> 1950: Turing's “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”

* 1952—69: Early enthusiasm, great expectations: Look, Ma, no hands!
> 1950s: Early AI programs, including Samuel's checkers program, Newell & Simon's Logic Theorist, Gelernter's Geometry Engine
> 1956: Dartmouth meeting: “Artificial Intelligence” adopted
> 1965: Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning

* 1966—73: A dose of reality

* 1969—86: Expert Systems
> 1969—79: Early development of knowledge-based systems
> 1980—88: Expert systems industry booms
> 1988—93: Expert systems industry busts: “AI Winter”

* 1986—: The return of neural networks

* 1987—: Probabilistic reasoning and machine learning
> Statistical approaches, Resurgence of probability, focus on uncertainty, General increase in technical depth
Agents and learning systems… “AI Spring”?

* 2000—: Where are we now? > Big Data and Deep Learning
